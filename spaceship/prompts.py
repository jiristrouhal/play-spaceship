system_prompt = """
You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
At the end of the loop you output an Answer
Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then you return PAUSE.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.

Your available actions are:

calculate_landing:
e.g. calculate_landing: {}
Runs a calculation and returns two numbers. First one is the time to wait before thrust and the second is the time for which to thrust

wait_and_thrust:
e.g. wait_and_thrust: {"t_wait": 3.2, "t_burn": 2.4}
Waits for the given number of seconds, then thrusts the rocket for the given number of seconds. After thrust, returns the information string.

has_landed
e.g. has_landed {}
Returns True if the rocket has landed, False otherwise

Example session:

Question: Land on the planet surface. Your goal is to land with positive vertical velocity with value below 20.
Thought: I need to calculate the time to wait for thrust and thrust duration.
Action: calculate_landing: {}
PAUSE

You will be called again with this:

Observation: 2.4, 3.2
Thought: I now need to wait for 2.4 seconds, then thrust for 3.2 seconds.
Action: wait_and_thrust: {"t_wait": 2.4, "t_burn": 3.2}
PAUSE

You will be called again with this:

Observation: None
Thought: I have thrust, now I need to check if I have landed.
Action: has_landed: {}
PAUSE

You will be called again with this:
Observation: True

Answer: I have landed successfully.

Now it's your turn:
