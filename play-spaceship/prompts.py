Your goal is to land on the surface. The spaceship has a single motor that can accelerate the spaceship in the direction of the spaceship's nose.

CONDITIONS:
  The spaceship must land
  - oriented "upwards" - with an angle of 0 degrees,
  - with a positive vertical speed of less than 1.0.
  - with a horizontal speed between -0.5 and 0.5.

BEHAVIOR:

  The spaceship state is defined by:
  - fuel: the amount of fuel left,
  - horizontal-speed (from left to right),
  - vertical-speed - POSITIVE when moving down, NEGATIVE when moving up,
  - horizontal-position (from left to right),
  - vertical-position (from bottom to top) - 0 means landed, more than 100 means high.
  - angle: the angle of the spaceship's nose in degrees, where:
    - The spaceship points upwards when the angle is 0.
    - The spaceship is oriented more right when the angle is negative.
    - The spaceship is oriented more left when the angle is positive
  -orientation: the orientation of the spaceship

CONTROLS:

  Orient the ship upwards and thrust to change vertical speed.
  Orient the ship left or right and thrust to change horizontal speed.
  You slow down the descent by orienting the spaceship upwards and thrusting upwards.
  If height is below 100, make sure ship is oriented upwards
  If the controls did not lead to desired outcome, try different ones.

  You control the spaceship by
  - key 'left' to rotate more left,
  - key 'right' to rotate more right,
  - key 'forward' for thrust forward.

You run in a loop of Check, Thought and Action1 and Action2.
Use Check to analyze the current state of the spaceship with respect to CONDITIONS.
Use Thought to decide what 'key' to press based on the Check. Consider always previous values in Check. Always remember BEHAVIOR and CONTROLS!!!
Return Action1:

{
  "function_name": "hold",
  "function_params": {"seconds": <seconds>, "key": <key>}
}



Example session:

  Check:
  {
    "time": 2024-10-07 11:05:53
    "game-on": True,
    "fuel": 500,
    "horizontal-speed": 4.0,
    "vertical-speed": 3,
    "horizontal-position": 15,
    "vertical-position": 197,
    "angle": 90
  }

  Thought: I need to orient the rocket upwards.

  Action:
  {
    "function_name": "hold",
    "function_params": {
      "seconds": 1.1,
      "key": "right"
    }
  }

  Check:
  {
    "time": 2024-10-07 11:05:53
    "game-on": True,
    "fuel": 500,
    "horizontal-speed": 4.0,
    "vertical-speed": 3,
    "horizontal-position": 15,
    "vertical-position": 107,
    "angle": 0
  }

  Thought: I need to thrust upwards as the vertical velocity is positive and higher than 1.0.

  Action:
  {
    "function_name": "hold",
    "function_params": {
      "seconds": 1.5,
      "key": "forward"
    }
  }
