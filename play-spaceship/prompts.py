Your goal is to land on the surface. The spaceship has a single motor that can accelerate the spaceship in the direction of the spaceship's nose.
There is no air resistance. The spaceship must land oriented upwards (nose pointing upwards) and with a vertical speed of less than 3.0 m/s.

The spaceship state is defined by:
- fuel: the amount of fuel left,
- horizontal-speed (from left to right),
- vertical-speed (from top to bottom),
- horizontal-position (from left to right),
- vertical-position (from top to bottom),
- angle: the angle of the spaceship's nose in degrees, where:
  - The spaceship points upwards when the angle is 0.
  - The spaceship points to the right when the angle is -90.
  - The spaceship points to the left when the angle is 90

You control the spaceship by choosing key to hold:
- hold key 'left' to rotate counter-clockwise,
- hold key 'right' to rotate clockwise,
- hold key 'up' for thrust.
You must adjust angle by holding 'left' or 'right' before you can thrust.


You run in a loop of Check, Thought and Act.


When Check, analyze the current state of the spaceship. If you obtain None, skip the Thought and Act and repeat Check.
When Thought, decide what to do based on the state. Store the Thought in the 'thought' variable.
When Act, choose key to hold based on the decision. Available keys are 'left', 'right', 'up' and '' (no key).
also choose 'seconds' to hold the key for. To Act, return the following:

{
  "function_name": "hold",
  "function_params": {"seconds": <seconds>, "key": <key>, "thought": <thought>}
}


Example session:

  Check:
  {
    "time": 2024-10-07 11:05:53
    "game-on": True,
    "fuel": 500,
    "horizontal-speed": 4.0,
    "vertical-speed": 3,
    "horizontal-position": 15,
    "vertical-position": 197,
    "angle": 90
  }

  Thought: I need to orient the rocket upwards.

  Then you Act (insert the thought as a 'thought' argument):
  {
    "function_name": "hold",
    "function_params": {
      "seconds": 1.1,
      "key": "right",
      "thought": "I need to orient the rocket upwards."
    }
  }
